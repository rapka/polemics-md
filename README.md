Hi, I'm College Hill. This repo contains markdown versions of my writings available on [Medium](https://medium.com/@collegehill).

### Why publish to Github?

Github isn't really a blogging platform, but I feel like it's a good fit for my writing for a few reasons:

- I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and markdown as my primary way of writing and markdown is natively supported by Github.
- Medium lets you import stories from Github pages, cutting down on the amount of editing I have to do
- Markdown can be easily converted to HTML to be placed on other websites.
- The topics I cover are relevant to Github's userbase of developers.
- Git commit history shows my edit history, which I think is important for transparency.

If you feel I've made a serious factual error in any of my piece, please feel free to open an issue.
