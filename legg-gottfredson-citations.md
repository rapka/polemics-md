J. (1981). The mismeasure of man. New York: Norton.")). Although explicit associations between racial groups and intelligence declined after the Second World War, (a) they continue to be made in right-wing circles (Saini [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-020-00415-6#ref-CR54 "Saini, A. (2019). Superior: The Return of Race Science. London: 4th Estate.")) and (b) implicit or unconscious associations between race and intelligence persist widely (see, for example, van den Bergh et al. [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-020-00415-6#ref-CR61 "van den Bergh, L., Denessen, E., Hornstra, L., Voeten, M., & Holland, R.
