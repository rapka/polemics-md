# The not-so-fringe PR firm behind the UK AI Fringe summit

The UK recently held a well-publicized [AI Safety Summit](https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/ai-safety-summit-2023)focusing on the risks presented by AI. A less well-publicized alternative summit also happened at the same time called [AI Fringe](https://aifringe.org/). I'm not British, but as someone who keeps up with tech industry news I was intrigued by a convention that was seemingly competing with an official government event and was curious as to who organized it.

According to their [FAQ](https://aifringe.org/faq), AI Fringe was planned by a firm called Milltown Partners in collaboration with groups on the list of [partner organizations](https://aifringe.org/#partners)on their website. However, this list has 25 different groups on it, making it hard to determine who originally came up with the idea for AI Fringe, but some investigation into Milltown Partners' history provides some clues.

## The Original Milltown Partners

In their own words, Milltown Partners is a "global advisory firm working with influential organisations and individuals on the communications and public policy challenges that define their reputations". In short, they are a PR company that does reputation management. 

The firm was founded in 2013 by three people:
- **Patrick "Paddy" Harverson** previously worked as a spokesman for Prince Harry, the Prince of Wales, and the Duchess of Cornwall from 2004-2013.
- **D-J Collins** served as Vice President of Communications and Public Policy for Google for 7 years before co-founding Milltown. The Guardian once [described](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/27/prince-charles-pr-consultancy-google) him as a "Google God" and "one of the most powerful people in technology PR".
- Before Milltown, **Oliver Rickman** held a string of PR positions at Google, culminating in being the Head of Strategic Planning & Campaigns for Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. He left Milltown Partners in 2016 to return to Google, this time as [director of marketing and public affairs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-rickman-09b93a27/details/experience/) for their DeepMind AI laboratory where he worked until leaving for Stripe in February 2023.

Beyond the two of the three founders of Milltown Partners being ex-Google employees, there's a number of other connections between AI Fringe and Google DeepMind. The [AI 101](https://aifringe.org/ai-101) informational page on AI Fringe's website includes artificial general intelligence (AGI) and risk (of the existential variety) as two of their 14 glossary terms; existential risk from AGI is a concept that many at DeepMind are [very concerned about](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/24/ai-risk-climate-crisis-google-deepmind-chief-demis-hassabis-regulation), despite the fact that there's no evidence that creating AGI is even possible in the near future. Nine of the speakers at AI Fringe also work for DeepMind, more than any other company.

## Milltown Partners' Partners

Milltown Partners clearly has many close ties to Google DeepMind, but some of the groups whose reputations they've chosen to defend are even more surprising.
#### Mohammed bin Salman

Milltown made the news in 2018 when their name was [revealed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/19/saudi-arabia-pays-uk-firms-millions-to-boost-image) to be one of several PR firms that worked with the royal family of Saudi Arabia. While Milltown refused to confirm if they had worked on behalf of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the wake of news [implicating him](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html) in the assassination of Jamal Kashoggi, an [article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/10/20/questions-riyadh-russias-links-independent/) from _The Telegraph_ about fellow news outlet _The Independent_ indicates that Milltown was involved with the Crown Prince earlier in that same year. The story goes on to detail how a Saudi investor by the name of Sultan Mohamed Abuljadayel appointed D-J Collins to the board of _The Independent_, adding that he was nicknamed "Mr. Saudi" by a friend.

#### Libyan Money Laundering

In addition to their ties to Saudi Arabia, Milltown was also implicated in a [defamation lawsuit](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-2nd-circuit/1873712.html) in 2015. The complaint from an employee of Dutch hedge fund Palladyne alleged that he was abruptly fired after he realized that his employers appeared to be laundering about $700 million USD on behalf of Ismael Abudher,  son-in-law of former Libyan prime minister Shukri Ghanem. The lawsuit [personally accuses](https://casetext.com/case/friedman-v-bloomberg-lp) Paddy Harverson of supplying quotes to Bloomberg as an unnamed source in order to defend Palladyne after Bloomberg previous [broke the news](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-27/palladyne-accused-in-suit-of-laundering-money-for-qaddafi) of the company's alleged fraud.

Being filed in America, Milltown's involvement in the lawsuit was dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction, but Dutch authorities have continued investigating Palladyne. Interestingly enough, a [2019 article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/canada-libya-snc-lavalin-scandal-corruption-gaddafi-trudeau-explained-a8821221.html) detailing the Dutch investigation into Palladyne was published _The Independent_.

AI Fringe billed their event with the tagline of " AIfor everyone". While may have been true in the strictest sense, the fact that this tagline was written by a company with close ties to DeepMind that specializes in reputation management raises a lot of doubts as to their sincerity, especially given their previous work. Despite Milltown Partners being co-founded by PR executives from one of the biggest tech companies in the world, AI Fringe's [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/AISummitFringe) has [reposted](https://twitter.com/MattLCapon/status/1720452600317812801) [several](https://twitter.com/rolandharwood/status/1720396430039220698)[tweets](https://twitter.com/GlitchUK_/status/1720759041998143680) from speakers at the summit decrying the influence of big tech in AI. From the looks of it, whatever PR plan Milltown had for its clients in organizing AI Fringe seems to have worked.
