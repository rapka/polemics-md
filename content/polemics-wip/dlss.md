On Open source/ai training;

There's a I sure as heck would want to talk about DLSS uf I worked on it and i've never met anyone who didn't like talking about their work. 

The lack of openness also contributes to a larger brain drain from academia and public institutions to private industry. Take John Carmack for example; I think we can all agree that his immense talents would better serve humanity if he was doing his R&D work in public instead of Mark Zuckerberg. Thankfully, we've already gotten a lot of public knowledge from him in the form of id's shareware and open sourcing of their old games. Quake II RTX for example only exists because a random PhD student was able to work on Quake II's open source to create Q2PVT.
