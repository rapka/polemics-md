Open Model Is Not Open Source

Open Source is still possible in projects that involve copyrighted content: the decompilation of Super Mario 64 for example requires that users supply their own copy of the game, in effect making the assets a dependency of the project in the same way a library is. In a machine learning context, authors could achieve this by providing either a direct link to their training data sets, or provide a script that will download the training data in real time[1]


[1] this approach is problematic from a bandwidth standpoint when applied to large data sets. multiple people scraping images from LAION-5b creates an undue burden on the servers hosting those images.
