how to design a good photo mode

i hate to pile onto the games [not great reception]() but i think this is a good example of the positives and negatives of its implementation

pros:
-the filters. they're all awesome


cons:
- **limited range of camera motion** the camera is prevented from getting too close to objects or characters. this is presumably done to avoid situations where the graphics are broken, but the distance your character is allowed to get is so large that it affect my ability to take creative shots
-**aspect ratios**
