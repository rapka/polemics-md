# Duplate culture, democratization & quality control

in an [Red Bull Music Academy feature on duplate culture](), early Drum n bass producers Lemon D and DJ Hype describe the process and the artistic environment it produced:
>Lemon D remembers the rich era of the mid-’90s when jungle was huge and Goldie’s label was king: “Metalheadz (the label) was right time, right place, right sound. You’d go down to Music House (a popular Jamaican-inspired cutting studio in London), and it was a little social club where people would experiment and cut dubplates for each other. It would define where the music would go in the next couple of months. You’d still be there at 9 PM clinging on to get a dubplate off someone even if you thought you might be missing your gig. You can’t get that now.”
>At cutting studios like Music House or Tubbys, these plates would cost anything from £25 to £45 depending on whether they were 7-, 10- or 12-inches. Bigger DJs like Hype – if he was particularly busy – wouldn’t have all day to queue at the more social cutting studios, so he’d spend anywhere from £50 to £90 at the more upmarket Heathmans or Metropolis.
> It’s amazing looking back how much I must have spent,” muses DJ Hype. “You really had to choose carefully. It’s what we called the ‘shit filter.’ Now this ‘shit filter’ has gone. If you had to pay £35 to upload just one song to Soundcloud, then the quality of music would be a lot better. Now anything can exist. And if you went to Music House to cut a DAT of music that was THAT shit, then we’d all be telling you off for even cutting it! It would never get to the dance floor.”

Many AI art platforms work in the exact opposite direction. Not only is there no shit filter on MidJourney, but all generationed images are added to a public Discord channel unless the user pays for access to privacy. This is not an environment that is condusive to quality art or a healthy culture. Beyond the obvious privacy problems, it removes the agency from users to decide if what they make is even worth sharing.  

Such a system also immediately decontextualizes the generated images from whatever their intended purpose may be. In my case, I use diffusion models primarily to assists in creating album art for my music. If I were to use MidJourney for this purpose, those images would be automatically dumped into the larger internet without the musical connection or the modifications I make to them before the art is finalized. 

MidJourney claims to want to empower artists, by they have created an environment that undermines the creative process for anyone attempting to use it for serious work... unless you cough up $30/month.

# Duplate culture, sampling & copyright

The Red Bull Music Academy article uses a DJ hype track called ["You Must think First"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re4oGqCxX4g). It begins with a sample of Wu-Tang Clan - The Mystery of Chessboxin' which in itself is a sample of the film "Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang" + "Five Deadly Venoms". It then employs the classic Think and Soul Pride breakbeats for its drums, sampled from James Brown and Lyn Collins respectively. DJ hype then layers a sample of an unknown reggae song on top as well as a vocal clip of someone saying "hey".

This makes for a total of at least four different sample sources in this track. Because the sample clearance process happens when official releases are being planned (if it happens at all), the house that cut the dubplate of "You Must Think First!!" profited off of art that was created almost entirely from data sources that were scraped from publicly available sources. This also extends to the musical direction of drum n bass being shaped by this environment; like "You Must Think First", the vast majority of jungle and early drum n bass tracks have relatively few musical elements that aren't sampled.

> y’all really be making me feel so seen. I literally be building worlds so that I can hear them broken down/rebuilt again. couldn’t be more grateful to come from club culture and be in this beautiful exchange wit so many incredibly talented peers.


# The Internet broke copyright even more

### The complaints against ai are the same as the complaints against hip-hop

I'm not the firtst person to come to this conclusion about ai. Yann LeCun had the same thought. The problem is that yann lecun is a hypocrite. Given MEta's contributions to PyTorch, he's the AI equivalent of Roger Linn designing the MPC for Akai

[pic of linn and yecun

There's a key difference here and that's that roger linn wasn't friends with the people making for-profit sample CDs with unlicensed samples. And these bootleg sample cd companies in the 90's weren't making billions of dollars.

Wu-Tang Clan

As a produer myself, I have a hobby of recreating famous examples of sampling as an excerise

Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger was cleared, but the sample that makes up the entirety of One More Time wasn't.

I'm not gonna get mad at these random French white boys for making beats in their bedrooms. I'm not gonna get mad at random people for making beats, especially if those beats are inspired by Todd "The God" Edwards. I think it's kinda shitty that Virgin Records didn't have their lawyers cut [artist] a fat check for it being a famous song once it blew up.

In between their unlicensed sampling Daft Punk had the courtesy to credit Todd Edwards as well as the many black house and techno artists that influenced them, both as part of their song "Teachers" and as part of the accompanying visuals during their Alive 1997 tour. In a move symbolic of the entire EDM scene, both the song and visuals were replaced by their now-iconic pyramid light display

> “I applaud attempts to develop tools to help artists,” Crabapple says. “But they ultimately put the burden on us, and that’s not where it should be. We shouldn’t have to play whack-a-mole to keep our work from being stolen and regurgitated by multibillion-dollar companies. The only solution to this is a legislative one.”


This is true, but any legislative solution is limited by the ability of governments to enforce it. Piracy is illegal and a (flawed) legislative solution was passed in the form of DMCA, but that wasn't enough to actually stop the behavior. As a result, we've seen increasingly complex and consumer-unfriendly technology solution proliferate while failing to stop the piracy problem. Models cannot be untrainined and groups who have already successful downloaded their own internal copies of the LAION-5B dataset can't effectively be forced to delete them without expensive and time-consuming lawsuits.

There's an 


A better legislative solution to help artists would be to pass medicare for all, UBI, affordable housing, and other policies that directly affect the material conditions of artists. Compared to AI-specific legislation, funding these policies with taxes levied on all corporation will be both more effective and more equitable. I cannot in good conscience be enthuiastic about how creating a new form of beaureacracy to manage IP rights with respect to AI will play out in the long term.

### Grime Archive

Let's use one of my favorite grime sets as an example: Logan Sama's last show on Rinse FM from 2005.


IN order to properly license the recording of this performances, the following entities would all need to be involved:

- Rinse FM. This is complicated by the fact that Rinse FM was an unlicensed pirate radio station from 1994-2010, illegally broadcasting their signal with clandestinely installed transmitters. The video to Skepta's DTI (which logan recently named as one of his top 5 Skepta tracks) has 
- Logan Sama, the DJ
- The 17 different MC's who performed: Riko Dan, Wiley, Skepta, Trim, Roachee, Scratchy, Flowdan, Manga, Footsie, Jammer, JME, Tinchy Stryder, Rapid, Slix, Maxwell D, Bruza, and Faction G
- The rightsholders for each of the tracks played by Logan Sama over the course of the two hours[^1]
	- Many of these tracks were not released at the time and some still aren't today
	- Some of these tracks also include samples, which probably weren't cleared regardless of whether or not they were relased
	- The first ~15 minutes of the mix largely consists of vocal dubplate specials, new (unreleased) vocals over existing beats). Both the vocalists and the producers would have to approve of each of these dubplates.

For example, the track played at 6:20 is another Sketpa track, Pulse Eskimo. This instrumental is a remix of Wiley - Eskimo which in turn samples the aliens from Toy Story.

>MONK ONE

So you were there for a most important landmark for Jamaican music and, to me, music in general. You can tell us more exactly, but you were there around ‘85 or so when the digital rhythms replaced the band rhythms and people you were working with, like Bobby Dixon, who goes by the name Bobby Digital at King Jammy‘s studio. What can you tell us about that time, and how...

STEELY

It was a little studio and we had an eight-track machine, no, four-track. And we had to play live because there was no sequencer. Might take the drums and the bass together but everything was played live, so it would be [_plays keyboards_]. We’d play that for four minutes straight, whole sequence. We had to play live, live, live because there was no sequencer, no MIDI.
