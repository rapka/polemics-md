This message is primarily intended for non-scientists who aren't aren't familiar with academia, the publishing process, and their pitfalls. Open access platforms like arXiv and its clones provide a very important service to the scientific community and their usefulness. However, given the recent public interest in various sciences as of late, I think a PSA explaning what preprint servers are and what limitations they have is warranted.

##### How traditional scietific publishing works

In a non-arXiv world, academic journals serve as the de facto curators of accepted scientific knowledge. They generally specialize in a particular academic field and new research papers published through them are typically peer reviewed by expert editors for the publication. These editors ultimately make the decisions as to which papers go through the peer review process and which ones are ultimately published.

The overall quality of a journal is usually judged using a formula how many citations these articles receive, such as the [Impact Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor). These heuristics have been heavily criticized though, as has the inherently exclusive nature of the peer process. Submitting to journals also tends to be a time-consuming and potentially expensive endeavor; the peer review process can take anywhere from a few months to years while many journals have submission fees that can vary from hundreds to thousands of dollars. And on the consumer side, access to these journal articles is often simiarly expensive unless the journal falls under the "open access" where the cost of giving away articles is often offset by higher submission fees for the authors. Universities will usually pay for journal access for their all students and faculty, but anyone not affiliated with an institution has to cough up the dough.

### Preprint servers to the rescue (?)

As the name implies, 


This isn't to say that anything on arXiv is *inherently* lower-quality than what might be published in a traditional journal; just that the existence of a paper on arXiv shouldn't constitute a seal of approval that a non-expert might give to a reputable journal. Each individual paper on arXiv should be considered on its own merits. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done for the lay-person.

Here's a strategy for reading papers in unfamiliar fields that was shared with me by a professor when I was in school.

1. Read the abstract
2. Read all the graphs, charts, and annotations
3. Read the conclusion

This approach is no replacement for actually reading and understanding the whole text, but I've found that it's a quick way to get a brief overview of what the paper is trying to convey without delving too far into technicalities that may be over one's head. This approach is also usually enough to expose any glaring flaws or red flags with the work that might not otherwise be apparent.

Unlike the unfair rejections alleged in the Scientific American article, computer science has the opposite problem. Arxiv [announced](https://blog.arxiv.org/2023/01/31/arxiv-announces-new-policy-on-chatgpt-and-similar-tools/) new rules regarding AI authorship on papers, but this doesn't address the deluge of papers studying LLMs such as ChatGPT as products unto themselves. There is surely a need for research that is critical of these services considering their many risks, but the black-box, cloud-based nature of these services inherently effects the usefulness of this research and many papers subsequently end up blurring the line between product review and science.

when it comes to machine learning, there's no bias but we see a deluge of llm bullshit instead
