"It's a record that was already made that they're just doing *gestures* to. And maybe they do it well. But if i edit the highlight reel of the super bowl it doesn't mean i'm a football player"

### The complaints against ai are the same as the complaints against hip-hop

I'm not the firtst person to come to this conclusion about ai. Yann LeCun had the same thought. The problem is that yann lecun is a hypocrite. Given MEta's contributions to PyTorch, he's the AI equivalent of Roger Linn designing the MPC for Akai

There's a key difference here and that's that roger linn wasn't friends with the people making for-profit sample CDs with unlicensed samples. And these bootleg sample cd companies in the 90's weren't making billions of dollars.

As a produer myself, I have a hobby of recreating famous examples of sampling as an excerise

Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger was cleared, but the sample that makes up the entirety of One More Time wasn't.

I'm not gonna get mad at these random French white boys for making beats in their bedrooms. I'm not gonna get mad at random people for making beats, especially if those beats are inspired by Todd "The God" Edwards. I think it's kinda shitty that Virgin Records didn't have their lawyers cut [artist] a fat check for it being a famous song once it blew up.

In between their unlicensed sampling Daft Punk had the courtesy to credit Todd Edwards as well as the many black house and techno artists that influenced them, both as part of their song "Teachers" and as part of the accompanying visuals during their Alive 1997 tour. In a move symbolic of the entire EDM scene, both the song and visuals were replaced by their now-iconic pyramid light display
