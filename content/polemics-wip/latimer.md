The Black GPT

I got an email announcing "The Black GPT"

- naming your bot after a black inventor, nicknaming it "The Black GPT", and training it on data from HBCUs isn't "for everyone". It's for black people. Where's the training data for all the other demographics?
- How big is the new, inclsive dataset? AI companies usually like to brag about it.
- Neither John Pasmore nor Esther Dyson have a technical background. Who is actually doing the labor of building and testing the model?
- Advertising Latimer as a tools to "create messages that resonate with authenticity" sounds like digital blackface. What kind of brand needs to create "authentic" messages but doesn't have anyone who can write authentically?
- Latimer is dubbed the "'official' choice of several colleges & universities because of the depth of historical content and mitigated bias". How much historical content is there? How do they know they mitigated the bias?
- Latimer can't be "establishing the building blocks of what the future of AI needs to include" when it's already built off an existing "foundation" model.
- All the press releases say Latimer is built off tech **"lik"e** LLaMa 2 and GPT-4, but doesn't actually say which model it uses.
-  Parmore's statements about Latimer make no sense. Let's dive into these two very contradictory sentences:

> “It's the existing AI’s Achilles heel,” said Latimer CEO and founder John Pasmore. “LLMs were created by scraping publicly available sources like articles and YouTube comments, which introduces bias.” 
> Latimer builds on top of current AI tech like Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama 2 model and GPT-4, the LLM that powers ChatGPT, but adds books, oral histories and local archives from communities that may not be as well represented in the data the models were trained on.
Regardless of whether Latimer is based off ChatGPT, Claude, or something else[^1], all of the major commercial LLMs are based off scraped data. Adding more data on top of that does not remove the flawed data that was present in the model in the 


- the homepage says "Know how Latimer's knowledge evolves. No black boxes. No biases. Just transparent algorithms shaped by vast, inclusive inputs.". This is 100% cap for the same reason as the above: all LLMs are black boxes and Latimer is built on an existing LLM. How are we going to know how Latimer's knowledge evolves.
- 
> Unlike other chatbots, my training includes sources from lesser-represented cultures, oral traditions, and localized archives. 

There is no way to know this for sure because other chatbots are black boxes.

> In an era where chatbots often echo singular perspectives, Latimer champions a chorus of diverse histories and voices.
> We've shifted from one-size-fits-all to one-for-all. Experience a chatbot that truly understands and resonates.


- The fact that it's English-only makes it by defnition not for everyone. This may seem like a nitpick, but the majority of black and brown people on this planet do not speak English


To follow Pasmore's analogy, what he's build is the equivalent of covering up an Achille's heel with with protective armor. That's not the same as not having one at all.

Latimer's privacy policy says that FutureSum's contact address is at 401 Park Avenue South, a WeWork address. This would be okay on its own, but the contact info in my waitlist confirmation email  says FutureSum is located at 875 Washington St, a co-working space from a different company. I don't know how a business can have two

FutureSum has other plans. A website is up for HeyAhh, which I'm guessing will be some kind of André 3000. A trademark for Banneker (named after [BenjaMin Banneker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Banneker)

Pasmore has also been involved in other-non ai business. He served as president of Movita ORganics vitamins, which are "made with fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs."that are "fermented for optimum performance" and "remove toxins and oxidants". Motiva's special process for these vitamins appears to be [buying them from Ashland](https://www.ashland.com/industries/healthwellnessandnutraceuticals/product-solutions/fermented-vitamins-and-minerals), the company that acutally owns the GPM trademark.
