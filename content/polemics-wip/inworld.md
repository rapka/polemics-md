# AI Hype Diaries #1: Microsoft gets Finessed

A few weeks before they were dragged into OpenAI's power struggle, Microsoft [announced](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948454/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-developer-tools-inworld-partnership) a partnership between Xbox an an AI company called [Inworld](https://inworld.ai/). As part of this deal, Inworld will create two tools for Microsoft: an "AI design copilot" that will "turn prompts into scripts" and an improved version of their current AI-based character engine.

I am not so sure that Microsoft vetted this company.

Isn't it a bit weird that all of these bots were created by mostly unique users whose names are all convenient related to the IP they're using?

Hermione granger was deisgned by WitchWeekly
Geralt of Rivia was created by Destiny Sword (a book in the Witch series is named "Sword of Destiny")
Chef Ramsay was created by Panini_Head
Bowser was created by King Morton (Bowser's father in Mario lore)
Wednesday Addams was created by CousinLit
Zeus was created by Lowkey_Lokip
TheGodfather was created by HolyCannoli
Pikachu was created by KetchumCorp
Noam Chomsky was created by NeoLibby

it goes on and on. Strangely, all of these chatbots simply say "Created by external user" once you enter them and none of these usernames seem to be present anywhere else on the website,

 I wouldn't dare cast aspersions on the good folks at Inworld, but it almost seems possible that all of these were created by the same person using different aliases and trying to be clever. To make matters more strange, my own modified character that I made sure to share to the web doesn't show up on the https://npc.ai/arcade page, leading me to believe that the models on this page are hardcoded. It would not be good for Inworld if these IP violating tools were being 	knowingly distributed through this page...
 
 Weirdly, the user "Gary-Arneson" does seem to correspond with a real person - according to LinkedIn, the real Gary Arneson is a technical recruiter for Microsoft focusing on AI. This makes his name appearing next to a microsfot-sponsored AI company that is blatantly ignoring copyright.
