How does Prolific tackle the ethical issues of online research?

On Reddit, the [official subreddit]() for Prolific (with a prolific employee on the mod team) describes their goal to "help improve human knowledge by connecting researchers with diverse participants around the world". Like the website, this description has not changed to reflect the company's new focus on commercial AI training and most of the posts on r/ProfileAc are reports of technical problems and survey that are suspicious or violate the rules. These posts appear to be the closest thing Prolific workers have to the freedom of association criteria from Fairwork (Prolific did not earn a point in this category).
 

r/ProlificAc isn't the only subreddit about the platform. Over on r/beermoney, "a community for people to discuss mostly online money-making opportunities", there are over 5000 posts discussing the platform. The vast majority of these are about the pay, in particular compared to MTurk and other. While the majority of the posts are positive about the pay when compared to the dismal competition, the hustler attitude of the community is a far cry from "helping improve human knowledge".

Prolific is far from the only ethically suspect task platform to appear. The CEO of CloudFlower proclaimed to the BBC in 2010 that " it's really hard to make a sweatshop out of digital work" while announcing his partnership with Samasource, a crowdsourcing platform that was working with Kenyanrefugees at the time. Samasource (now just "Sama")[was recently revealed]() to be paying their Kenyan workers less than $2/hour to moderate violent and sexual content generated by OpenAI's products. This followed another [lawsuit](https://time.com/6175026/facebook-sama-kenya-lawsuit/) over Sama's deal with Facebook to help with content moderation. This also proved to be traumatizing to workers, who also accused Sama hiring non-Kenyan workers under false pretenses - a form of human trafficking. 

The controversies don't stop there. T In 2021, the Wall Street Journal discovered that a crowdsourcing app named [Presmise]() with users in the Middle East [secretly shared data with the US military](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550622/premise-app-surveillance-gig-work-military-contracts).
