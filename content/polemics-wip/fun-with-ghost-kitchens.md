In light of the recent dueling lawsuits between MrBeat and Virtual Dining Concepts, his ghost kitchen company, I decided to do a little investigation into my own local ghost kitchen scene in the DC area.

Browsing through the listing MrBeast Burger locations, many of them are run from existing burger joints like Z-Burger. However, the Alexandra VA location is a little more interesting

Google Maps doesn't list this or any of the other address as being a MrBeast Burger, but it does list two other ghost kitchen brands:

Man vs Fries (3.2 stars out of 5 and incorrectly labeled as a Mexican restaurant) and
Wow Bao, a Chinese restaurant with 2 / 5 stars.

Man vs Fries is an independently operated ghost kitchen brand unrelated to Virtual Dining Concepts, which means that this Alexdria ghost kitchen is juggling several ghost kitchen apps from different management firms.

Man vs Fries advertizes itself as a "black-owned business" which is technically true, but its pitch of minority empowered is a bit misleading. The black owner in question is one Bill Bonhorst, a San Fransisco based tech entrepeneur whose previous experience was in parking technology and venture capital. His Twitter biography speaks volumes:

As does his introduction in an interview in Authority Magazine:

>William Bonhorst is the CEO & Founder of Man vs Fries. Thinking outside the brick and mortar restaurant space, he built Man vs Fries as a delivery first brand born on DoorDash and raised on Instagram. Prior to becoming a food entrepreneur, his passion for leveraging technology in antiquated industries like parking and urban mobility led him to consultancy roles for San Francisco technology startups including portfolio companies of K9 Ventures and Khosla Ventures.
>
Besides the above, it should be emphasized that only the Man vs. Fries _brand_ is black-owned; nothing is known about the ownership of the individual kitchens that are preparing your food. A bon appetit article on ghost kitchens paints a similarly misterious picture of the state of compensation in Man vs. Fries' kitchens.

> Working with a ghost kitchen company also requires chefs to give up a lot of control. They’re not buying the ingredients or hiring the staff. When asked if his Man vs. Fries staffers working in Reef kitchens were being fairly compensated, Bornhorst said he didn’t know and never thought to ask about pay.
> 
> Ironically, this interview is proudly advertised on Man vs Fries' website. I guess they didn't expect people to actually read the full article.
> 
> 
> 
> Wow Bao

Wow Bao has a few big plusses, especially when compared to other ghost kitchens:
> They had real restaurant locations before moving into the ghost kitchen industry
> Ghost kitchens buy frozen dumpling from Wow Bao rather than using their existing ingredients, which improves quality control
> Wow Bao only makes money off the sale of the frozen ingredients, rather than taking a cut out of every purchase.
> 
However, there's still some downsides:Wow Bao only has an "asian-inspired menu" rather than being minority owned. its CEO is a very white man named Geoff Alexander and the restaurant brand is part of a larger group of non-asian restaurant chains


>Wow Bao Launches The Hot Buns Club and Creates
Unique Digital CollectaBaos to Enhance its
Points-Based, Bao Bucks Rewards Program
>Wow Bao is the first virtual restaurant to
combine a web3 integrated loyalty program with a traditional rewards program


> When you order from WowBao.com in August 2023, you’ll receive a FREE, unique Collect-a-Bao, Wow Bao’s digital collectible/NFT that comes with perks, rewards, and entry into the Hot Buns Club.
