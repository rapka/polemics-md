lance riddler is not real , liam lied. the fact that this extremely obvious lie has gone unnoticed for 29 years is a sign of how dumb the state of copyrifht is. liam ddidm't lie to maliciously plagiarise, he lied so the fucking lawyers can get off his back. i am not unique in my ability to remake this track. 

even if howlett were to hire a dude named Lance to replay

One clue that Voodoo people is a sample is the very last second of the loop: listening carefully, you can hear both the change in tone from timestretching as well as the beginning of the next guitar strum. If the sample were replayed, neither of those would be necessar as "Lance Riddler" could've simply held the note for a longer duration. 

This is my remake using the Nirvana sample. it took about 15 minutes to create by simply adding EQ, distrotion, and a phase effect.

It's theoretically possible that some anonymous guitarist could perform a perfect rendition of Very Ape in the studio with Liam, but this ignores the differences in equipment available to Liam Howlett and Kurt Cobain. In Utero was famously recorded by legendary producer Steve Albini as Cobain was a fan of Albini's unconvential techniques. It would be nigh impossible to accurately recreate the tone of Very Ape in a different studio without Albini's technique and the gear used by Cobain.

To be clear, I'm not upset at Howlett in the slightest. On top of the infamous UK Crime Bill that was the impetus for Jilted, other lawsuits related to sampling were a concern as well. Given that Grohl is cited as having enthuiastically approved the sample (calling The Prodigy "the best rock band in the world"), I can only conclude that the deception was done to keep the lawyers off his back. At the time, Nirvana's music was on DGC, as sublabel of Geffen Records which in turn had recently been acquired by MCA Music Entertainment. MCA would later rebrand to Universal Music Group, one of the "Big Three" major labels that dominate the industry today.
