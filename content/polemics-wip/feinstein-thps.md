# Dragon Lady with no heart: Dianne Feinstein, Jello Biafra, and the legacy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater

### Timeline The Moscone-Milk Assassinations

### Timeline of the Dead Kennedys


It is with all this context that Neversoft decided to license the Dead Kennedys song "Police Truck" for a new game they were working on called Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. THPS featured a level set in San Francisco as a homage to The Search for Animal Chin, a classic skate video that featured Tony Hawk an other skaters who were sponsored by Powel Peralta.

What the Search For Animal Chin doesn't feature, however, is any destruction of police cars in San Francisco

It's possible all this is a coincidence. I before learning the details surrounding the White Night Riot, I just thought Police Truck was a general anti-cop song rather than one specifically about the SFPD under Dianne Feinstein and I can easily see how someone at Neversoft might make that mistake. However, it would be virtually impossible for people at Neversoft/Activison to at least know about the DKs connection to SF and the flaming cop car on the cover of their debut album.

  THPS's adevertising leaned into the cops as being anti-skater and featured a hidden character named Officer Dick 
  
Ironically, Jello himself woud probably not approve of the relatively generic "fuck cops" message. His lyrics to the Dead Kennedys song Riot (which was also dedicated to Feinstein in a 1982 live performance) take aim at rioters only interested in property damage in poor neighborhood as

> Pull down your dress, here's a kick in the ass  
> Let's beat you blue, 'till you shit your pants  
> Don't move child, I got a big black stick  
> There's six of us babe, so suck on my dick  

> Pull down your dress, here's a kick in the ass  
> Let's beat you blue--  
> Don't move child, I got a big black stick  
> There's six of us babe-- 

To complicate matters further, the timing of a standard session of THPS work out so that a loud beeping sound announcing the end of the timing always plays over the last verse. The word "shit" is also censored from this verse, which combined with a cacophony of other loud sound effects meant that a chilhood College HIll didn't really pick up on the 

 while Police Truck lasts 2:24. The timing works out such that the last verse is always interrupted by the loud beeping sound that begins 10 second before the timer run out. The song's lyrics in the last two verses were also censored pretty heavily. 

The left newspapers might whine a bit
But the guys at the station, they don't give a shit
Dispatch calls, "Are ya doin' somethin' wicked?"
"No siree, Jack, we're just givin' tickets!" 

THPS also has a fairly disjointed sense of geography when compared to the real world. The game portrays Jackson Street (the only named road in the level) as located right next to Chinatown's famous Dragon Gate while they're on opposite ends of the neigborhood in reality.

The credits for THPS have two Dead Kennedy related items. One of them was Police Truck, taken from the "Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death" compilation and credited to a label called Decay Music. Decay Music was one of several labels that [reissued Give Me Convenience](https://www.discogs.com/master/31844-Dead-Kennedys-Give-Me-Convenience-Or-Give-Me-Death) in the years since its release alongside Alternative Tentacles.
