>. I've always been a big fan of reading comments. Hell, I go on hackernews not to read the headlines, just to see what people say about them. I did that with SSC and LW too. And just like LW, SSC's comment section started to get...well, quite a bit more neo-liberal (look at any vaguely economic post and you'll see what I mean), and nazi (I don't know how you work neo-eugenics into a discussion about psychiatric medical side effects but those commentators worked hard for their neo-nazi credentials, I guess).
